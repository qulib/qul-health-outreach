# QUL Gatsby Wordpress

A simple Gatsby + WordPress site to get up and running with this stuff. 

For the WordPress piece, I'm using a locally hosted version on Docker using the URL qul.wordpress. This can be changed to any WordPress URL provided the REST API hasn't been turned off. 

I'm also using Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) with the ACF to REST API plugin to make that part work.
